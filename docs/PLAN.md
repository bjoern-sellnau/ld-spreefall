# SPREE|FALL, architecture and plan

A walkable first person reconstruction of central Berlin that runs from a single
static link. Raw WebGL2, own physics, own audio, own data pipeline. No engine, no
3D library, no runtime dependency.

## 1. Coordinate system

Bounding box, WGS84: south 52.5080, west 13.3650, north 52.5250, east 13.4150.
Projection origin: 52.5163 N, 13.3777 E (Brandenburg Gate).

We use a local equirectangular metric plane, which over a 2.7 km by 1.9 km box is
accurate to a few centimetres, far below what a walker can perceive:

    x = (lon - lon0) * 111320 * cos(lat0)      east, metres
    z = -(lat - lat0) * 110574                 south, metres, so +z is south
    y = up, metres

One unit is one metre. The world is right handed with y up. The playable plane is
about 3386 m east to west and 1880 m north to south.

Spawn: Pariser Platz, 52.51625 N, 13.37940 E, eye height 1.7 m, facing west
towards the Gate.

## 2. Data pipeline, tools/

Stages, each one a separate module so it can be tested on its own:

1. `fetch-osm.mjs` queries the Overpass API for the bounding box and caches the
   raw XML in `data/raw/berlin-center.osm`. Retries with exponential backoff and
   jitter on 429 and 504. If every mirror is unreachable it falls back to
   `synth-osm.mjs`.
2. `synth-osm.mjs` writes an OSM XML file in exactly the same schema from a
   curated table of real Berlin coordinates (street centrelines, landmark
   footprints, the Spree, parks) plus procedurally placed perimeter blocks. This
   exists so the project builds and is playable in a sandbox with no network. It
   is a fallback, never a preference: if `data/raw/berlin-center.osm` came from
   Overpass, that file is used untouched.
3. `osm-xml.mjs` is our own parser. A single pass tokeniser over the XML text
   producing `{nodes, ways, relations}` with tag maps. No XML library.
4. `earcut.mjs` is our own ear clipping triangulator with hole support. The hole
   elimination step follows the bridge method described by Eberly, "Triangulation
   by Ear Clipping" (2002), section 3: find the hole vertex with maximum x, cast
   a ray to the right, split the outer ring with a two sided bridge.
5. `build-world.mjs` turns the parsed OSM into geometry:
   buildings (walls, flat, gabled, hipped and domed roofs), roads (ribbon meshes
   with joins), pedestrian areas, water, parks and grass, trees, rails and trams,
   the procedural stelae field, and the landmark specials.
6. Tiling: the world is cut into 100 m by 100 m tiles. Every triangle is assigned
   to the tile containing its centroid. Per tile we write an interleaved vertex
   buffer, an index buffer, and a collision blob.
7. `bundle.mjs` writes `public/world.bin` plus `public/world.json`.

### 2.1 Vertex format, 20 bytes, interleaved

    offset  type        name
    0       int16 x3    position, tile local, quantised at 1/64 m
    6       int8  x3    normal, signed normalised
    9       int8        material id low byte is also carried in the byte at 14,
                        this slot holds the vertex ambient occlusion term
    10      uint16 x2   uv in units of 1/32 m, so up to 2048 m of run
    14      uint8       material id
    15      uint8       per building random seed
    16      uint8       building levels, 0 when not a building
    17      uint8       facade flags: bit 0 ground floor, bit 1 landmark
    18      uint16      building height in 1/16 m, for the facade shader

Indices are uint16 when the tile has fewer than 65536 vertices, otherwise uint32.
The manifest records which.

### 2.2 Collision blob, per tile

    uint16 segCount
    uint16 gridN            always 33, a 33 by 33 height field over the tile
    segCount x {
      int16 x1, z1, x2, z2  tile local, 1/64 m
      uint16 base           1/32 m
      uint16 top            1/32 m
      uint8  surface        0 asphalt 1 cobble 2 grass 3 water 4 gravel
      uint8  pad
    }
    gridN*gridN x int16     ground height, 1/256 m, plus a per tile base

Segments are the outward oriented footprint edges of every solid, so the
character controller only ever has to test 2D segments plus a vertical span.

### 2.3 Manifest, world.json

    {
      version, origin{lat,lon}, bbox, tileSize, tileCountX, tileCountZ,
      groundBase, materials[], landmarks[], roadLines[] (for the minimap),
      tiles[ { tx, tz, min[3], max[3], vOff, vCount, iOff, iCount, iType,
               cOff, cLen, tris } ]
    }

## 3. Engine, src/engine/

- `math.mjs`: vec2, vec3, vec4, mat4, quat over Float32Array with a scratch pool,
  so the hot path never allocates. Frustum extraction, ray versus AABB, ray versus
  triangle.
- `gl.mjs`: context creation, shader compile with the offending source line
  printed, program cache, VAO helper, uniform buffer objects for the shared camera
  and lighting block.
- `renderer.mjs`: render queue sorted by program then material, per frame stats.
- `tiles.mjs`: streams tile ranges out of `world.bin` with HTTP range requests
  when available and one full fetch otherwise, uploads on demand, keeps a budget
  around the player, frustum culls per tile.
- `input.mjs`: pointer lock mouse look, touch look plus virtual stick, keyboard,
  Gamepad API.
- `controller.mjs`: capsule radius 0.35 m, height 1.8 m. Swept in up to four
  substeps, slides along contact normals, steps up to 0.4 m, gravity 22 m/s^2,
  jump 5.2 m/s. The river is a solid wall to the player.
- `loop.mjs`: fixed 60 Hz simulation with an accumulator and interpolated render
  state.

## 4. Render, src/render/

Sun position from the standard NOAA solar position equations for the given date,
time and latitude. Sky is an analytic Rayleigh plus Mie gradient with a sun disc,
rendered as a full screen triangle at maximum depth. Two cascade shadow maps at
2048 and 1024 for the near and far ranges. Facades are generated in the fragment
shader from the per building seed: window grid derived from the level count,
shopfront band on the ground floor, plaster colour from `building:colour` or from
a Berlin palette, emissive windows at night with a per window random on state.
Roads draw lane markings and kerbs from the uv run, cobblestone uses a Worley like
cell noise, water uses two scrolling normal waves and a sky reflection
approximation. Trees are instanced billboards with a real trunk quad cross.
Post: tone map (ACES fit), threshold plus blur bloom, FXAA, vignette. A quality
tier is chosen from the mean frame time over the first three seconds.

## 5. Game, src/game/

Intro drone shot over Pariser Platz on a spline, then a Press to walk prompt.
Landmark discovery inside 40 m with a sliding card. Minimap on a 2D canvas from
`roadLines`. Photo mode on P. URL state in the hash: `#x,z,yaw,pitch,tod`.
Audio graph built on the first gesture: ambience beds crossfaded by proximity to
roads, water, park and stations, plus footsteps whose sample is picked from the
surface id under the player.

## 6. Milestones

1. Pipeline prints stats and the unit test on the L shaped courtyard passes.
2. A grey box city renders at 60 fps and the player cannot walk through a wall.
3. It looks like Berlin at golden hour from Pariser Platz.
4. The game layer is complete and a screenshot is worth sharing.
5. `dist/` deploys to GitHub Pages with no console errors.

## 7. Deviations from the original brief

Recorded here as they happen, per the working style.

- 2026-09-08: the sandbox running this build has an egress policy that denies
  every OpenStreetMap host (`overpass-api.de`, all Overpass mirrors,
  `download.geofabrik.de`, `nominatim`, the tile servers) with a 403 at the proxy.
  The Overpass client in `tools/fetch-osm.mjs` is complete and is what runs when a
  network is available. Because the build has to produce something playable, the
  fallback in `tools/synth-osm.mjs` emits an OSM XML document from real, checked
  Berlin coordinates for every street centreline, landmark footprint, park and
  waterway in the box, and fills the remaining blocks with generated perimeter
  buildings. Everything downstream of the parser is identical either way. The
  README states plainly which parts are surveyed geometry and which are
  generated.

- 2026-09-08: the brief gives the east edge as 13.4050 and in the same paragraph
  says the box covers Alexanderplatz and the TV Tower, and phases 3, 4 and 5 all
  depend on the tower. The tower stands at 13.40942 and Alexanderplatz at
  13.4131, both east of 13.4050. The landmark list wins over the number, so the
  east edge is 13.4150 and the playable plane is 3386 m by 1880 m.
- 2026-09-08: the Victory Column is at 13.3501, west of the box on any reading,
  so it is left out, as the brief allows.
- 2026-09-09: three defects found by measurement rather than by looking, all
  recorded here because each was invisible in the code:
  1. Every wall and every solid was wound against the normals it declared, so
     with back face culling the whole city would have rendered inside out. Found
     by the watertight test on the L shaped courtyard fixture, before the
     renderer existed. There is now a test that checks the winding of every
     generator against its own normals.
  2. The view distance was a vertex attribute, so on a triangle the size of
     Pariser Platz the ground under the player reported ninety metres. That
     picked the wrong shadow cascade and switched off every ground texture. It
     is now computed per fragment from the interpolated world position.
  3. Procedural patterns with no mip chain alias into moire. Distance thresholds
     do not fix this, because the pixel footprint at a grazing angle has nothing
     to do with distance. Every ground pattern now widens its own edges to the
     measured screen space footprint, which is what a mip chain would have done.
- 2026-09-09: the base ground grid is not drawn where a road, square, park, water
  body, building or the memorial already covers it, which removes about a quarter
  of the cells. It is also drawn ninety millimetres low, because the grid
  interpolates the terrain linearly over 12.5 m and a base plane at the true
  height pokes through everything laid on top of it.
- 2026-09-09: at street level in a city this dense, the Fernsehturm is not
  visible from Pariser Platz: it subtends ten degrees at two kilometres, and any
  twenty metre building within a hundred and ten metres of the sightline hides
  it. The fog is tuned as the brief asks, and the shot that shows it is taken
  from Schlossplatz, where the sightline is real.
